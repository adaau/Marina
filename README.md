#About
MARINA is a boat-sharing app to connect boat owners and boat renters.

The premise behind this "sharing economy" app is to create a marketplace for boats: owners, who seldom use their boats, can monetize their boats during idle time and offset some of the huge operating costs; renters, who don't have access to boats, can now have access to a huge supply of boats.
